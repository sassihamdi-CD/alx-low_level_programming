## 0x09-static_libraries

This directory covers the creation and use of static libraries in C.

### Files
- **0-isupper.c**: A C program that checks for uppercase characters.
- **0-memset.c**: A C program that fills memory with a constant byte.
- **0-strcat.c**: A C program that concatenates two strings.
- **1-isdigit.c**: A C program that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- **1-memcpy.c**: A C program that copies memory area.
- **1-strncat.c**: A C program that concatenates two strings, using at most `n` bytes from `src`.
- **100-atoi.c**: A C program that converts a string to an integer.
- **2-strchr.c**: A C program that locates a character in a string.
- **2-strlen.c**: A C program that returns the length of a string.
- **2-strncpy.c**: A C program that copies a string.
- **3-islower.c**: A C program that checks for lowercase characters.
- **3-puts.c**: A C program that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
- **3-strcmp.c**: A C program that compares two strings.
- **3-strspn.c**: A C program that gets the length of a prefix substring.

- **4-strpbk.c**: A C program that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- **5-strstr.c**: A C program that locates a substring.
- **6-abs.c**: A C program that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- **9-strcpy.c**: A C program that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
- **_putchar.c**: A C program that writes a character to `stdout`.
- **create_static_lib.sh**: A shell script that creates a static library called `libmy.a` from all the `.c` files in the current directory.
- **libmy.a**: The static library created from the `.c` files.
- **main.h**: A header file containing function prototypes used in the static library programs.
