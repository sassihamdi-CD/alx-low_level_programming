- **1-string_nconcat.c**: A C program that concatenates two strings, using at most `n` bytes from the second string.
- **2-calloc.c**: A C program that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`, and initializes it to zero.
- **3-array_range.c**: A C program that creates an array of integers containing all the values from `min` (included) to `max` (included), ordered from `min` to `max`.
