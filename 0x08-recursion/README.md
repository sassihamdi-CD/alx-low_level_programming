## 0x08-recursion

This directory covers the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a problem.

### Files
- **0-puts_recursion.c**: A C program that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
- **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: A C program that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line, using recursion.
- **2-strlen_recursion.c**: A C program that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- **3-factorial.c**: A C program that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- **4-pow_recursion.c**: A C program that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.
- **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: A C program that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.
- **6-is_prime_number.c**: A C program that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns `0`, using recursion.
- **100-is_palindrome.c**: A C program that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not, using recursion.
- **101-wildcmp.c**: A C program that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns `0`, using recursion.
