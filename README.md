 # ALX - Low Level Programming - C Language

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises covering various topics in low-level programming using the C language. The projects are designed to introduce and reinforce important concepts and techniques in programming, including variables, control flow, functions, pointers, memory allocation, file input/output, and more.

Each project is contained within its own directory and contains a set of tasks or exercises to complete. The projects build on one another, with later projects exploring more advanced concepts and techniques.
