## Projects
This repository contains a collection of introductory and advanced programs in C, covering a wide range of topics in low-level programming. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a set of tasks or exercises to complete. The projects build on one another, with later projects exploring more advanced concepts and techniques.

### Directory Descriptions
- **0x00-hello_world**: Contains introductory programs that demonstrate how to output text to the console or terminal.
- **0x01-variables_if_else_while**: Covers the basics of variables and control flow statements, such as if-else statements and loops.
- **0x02-functions_nested_loops**: Covers the basics of writing and calling functions, as well as more advanced looping techniques like nested loops.
- **0x03-debugging**: Focuses on techniques for finding and fixing errors in code.
- **0x04-more_functions_nested_loops**: Builds on the concepts covered in 0x02, with more advanced functions and nested loops.
- **0x05-pointers_arrays_strings**: Covers the basics of pointers, arrays, and strings in C.
- **0x06-pointers_arrays_strings**: Continues the exploration of pointers, arrays, and strings, with a focus on more advanced concepts and techniques.
- **0x07-pointers_arrays_strings**: Further expands on pointers, arrays, and strings, with a focus on dynamic memory allocation and other advanced topics.
- **0x08-recursion**: Covers the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
- **0x09-static_libraries**: Covers the creation and use of static libraries in C.
- **0x0A-argc_argv**: Covers the use of command-line arguments in C programs.
- **0x0B-malloc_free**: Covers dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using the malloc and free functions.
- **0x0C-more_malloc_free**: Continues the exploration of dynamic memory allocation, with a focus on more advanced techniques and concepts.
- **0x0D-preprocessor**: Covers the role of the C preprocessor in modifying code before compilation.
- **0x0E-structures_typedef**: Focuses on defining and using structures and typedefs in C.
- **0x0F-function_pointers**: Explores the use of function pointers in C.
- **0x10-variadic_functions**: Covers functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
- **0x12-singly_linked_lists**: Introduces the concept of singly linked lists.
- **0x13-more_singly_linked_lists**: Expands on singly linked lists with more advanced operations.
- **0x14-bit_manipulation**: Covers techniques for manipulating individual bits within data.
- **0x15-file_io**: Focuses on file input/output operations in C.
- **0x17-doubly_linked_lists**: Introduces doubly linked lists and their operations.
- **0x18-dynamic_libraries**: Covers the creation and use of dynamic libraries in C.
- **0x1A-hash_tables**: Explores the implementation and use of hash tables.
- **0x1C-makefiles**: Covers the use of makefiles to automate the build process.
- **0x1E-search_algorithms**: Focuses on various search algorithms and their implementations.
